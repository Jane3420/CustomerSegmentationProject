## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** for a travel agency, analyzing a dataset of **2,000 customers** to identify key groups using **clustering techniques**. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.  

### 🔬 **Key Objectives:**  
✅ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and distributions.  
✅ Apply **K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering** to group customers based on demographics.  
✅ Identify **optimal clusters** using the **Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis**.  
✅ Provide **marketing recommendations** based on customer profiles.

## 📊 Data Insights  
### 🧐 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Dataset consists of **age, income, gender, marital status, education, occupation, and settlement size**.  
- **Income distribution** is right-skewed, with a small percentage of high earners.  
- **Gender ratio**: ~60% Female, ~40% Male.  
- **Marital Status**: Evenly split (50.05% married, 49.95% single).  

### 🔢 **Clustering Methods & Results**  
✅ **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score** determined **2 clusters** as the optimal number.  
✅ **K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering** identified two major customer segments:  
1. **Younger, Moderate-Income Group**  
   - Primarily **single females (~33 years old)** with **moderate income (~$103K)**.  
   - Reside mostly in **rural or small towns**.  
   - Likely in **lower-tier jobs or unemployed**.  
   
2. **Older, High-Income Group**  
   - Primarily **married males (~48 years old)** with **high income (~$171K)**.  
   - Reside in **large cities**.  
   - Hold **professional or managerial roles**.
